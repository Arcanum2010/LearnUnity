The projects are covered under the MIT open source license.\r\n\r\n\r\n# The App\r\n\r\nThe [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/)-style bowling game developed by following the book, complete with Asset Store assets and Unity Standard Assets, is [on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/learn-unity/id634845779 Learn Unity app). There is also an Android version [on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.technicat.HyperBowlComplete) and the [Amazon appstore](http://www.amazon.com/Technicat-LLC-Learn-Unity/dp/B00DHYHKJU)\r\n\r\n# The Book\r\n\r\nLearn Unity 4 for iOS Game Development is now available!\r\n\r\n* [Apress](http://www.apress.com/9781430248750) (print, pdf, epub and mobi) Alpha purchasers should download  the latest, final.\r\n* [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Learn-Unity-iOS-Game-Development/dp/1430248750) (print and kindle book)\r\n* [Barnes and Noble](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/learn-unity-4-for-ios-game-development-philip-chu/1113931582?ean=9781430248750) (print and nook book)\r\n* [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17063557-learn-unity-4-for-ios-game-development) (links to online bookstores)\r\n* [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books/about/Learn_Unity_4_for_iOS_Game_Development.html)\r\n* [iBookstore](\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/book/learn-unity-4-for-ios-game/id670921450?mt=11)\r\n* [Indigo](http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/books/item/1430248750-item.html?s_campaign=aff-001-1944216-Goodreads%2C+Inc-ProductCatalog-10408997-2227948)\r\n\r\nThe book introduces Unity starting with installation and activation, learning the interface with the included Angry Bots demo, and then builds up successively more elaborate project examples from scratch and using free assets from the Unity Asset Store.\r\n\r\nA simple spinning cube and dancing skeleton scene is constructed, but most of the book is devoted to building a 3D bowling game with the control style of [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/). The game is first developed and tested in the Unity Editor, incorporating graphics, scripting (with JavaScript), physics, sound, user interface, complete rules for a bowling game, and mouse controls. The game is then adapted to run on iOS with touchscreen and (a little bit of) accelerometer input. Testing with the Unity Remote, iOS Simulator and real devices is explained, Game Center and iAd integration is covered, and then optimization techniques are described. The book concludes with a brief treatment of miscellaneous topics such as C# scripting, Unity Editor scripting, Android development, and tracking and promoting sales.\r\n\r\nTechnical review was provided by Marc Sh√•rer of [Gayasoft](http://gayasoft.ch).\r\n\r\n## Chapter Contents\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\nDownload and install Unity, license activation, bug reporting, getting help.\r\n\r\n### A Unity Tour\r\n\r\nUse the Angry Bots demo to learn the Unity user interface: built-in and custom layouts, the Scene, Game, Hierarchy, Inspector and Project Views, how to open a project, open a scene and play a scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Making a Scene\r\n\r\nCreate a new scene with primitive objects, lighting, skybox, camera control, importing Standard Assets, and making prefabs.\r\n\r\n### Making it Move: Scripting the Cube\r\n\r\nCreate scripts, understanding callbacks, editing with MonoDevelop, debugging with MonoDevelop.\r\n\r\n### Let's Dance!

The book does mention but does not use Mecanim. Instead, a chapter is devoted to a dancing skeleton example using Unity's Legacy animation system and a free skeleton package on the Asset Store.\r\n* Some retail descriptions list Unity's support for gyroscope on iOS devices. The book does mention but does not use Unity's gyroscope API (Input.gyroscope). The book does describe how to access the touchscreen (Input.touches), accelerometer (Input.accelerometer), and webcam (WebCamTexture).\r\n\r\n## Ebooks\r\n\r\n### Apress alpha\r\n\r\n* Hasn't been updated to the final copy.\r\n\r\n### Nook\r\n\r\n* URL's display with markup and are not active as links.\r\n* All the quoted titles in the Explore Further sections should be links to the Unity online documentation (for the Scripting Reference pages, try searching for those terms in the Scripting Reference search box).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Kindle\r\n\r\n* Figure links don't always work.\r\n* Same issue as the nook re missing links in the Explore Further sections.\r\n\r\n## Text\r\n\r\nPage numbers correspond to the print version.
